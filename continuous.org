** Informal Description of Continuity

Roughly:

Suppose a function $f$ has the value $f(p)$ at a certain point $p$. Then $f$ is said to be continuous at $p$ if at every nearby point $x$ the function value $f(x)$ is close to $f(p)$.

** The Definition of the Limit of a Function

Let $f$ be a function defined in some open interval containing a point $p$, although we do not insist that $f$ be defined at the point $p$ itself. Let $A$ be a real number. The equation

$\lim\limits_{x \to p} f(x) = A$ 

It is also written without the limit symbol as such $f(x) \to A$ as $x \to p$

*** Definition of Neighborhood of a Point

Any open interval containing a point $p$ as its midpoint is called a neighborhood of $p$

*Notation*: Since a neighborhood $N(p)$ is an open interval symmetric about $p$, it consists of all real $x$ satisfying $p - r < x < p + r$ for some $r > 0$. $N(p;r)$ consists of all points $x$ whose distance from $p$ is less than $r$.

*** Definition of Limit of a Function

The symbolism $\lim\limits_{x \to p} f(x) = A$ means that for every neighborhood $N_1(A)$, there is some neighborhood $N_2(p)$ such that $f(x) \in N_1(A)$ whenever $x \in N_2(p)$ and $x \neq p$.

[[file:Continuous Functions/screenshot_2020-10-26_13-16-33.png]]

This definition involves two neighborhoods, $N_1(A)$ and $N_2(p)$. 
The neighborhood $N_1(A)$ is specified first; it tells us how close we wish $f(x)$ to be to the limit $A$.
The second neighborhood $N_2(p)$ tells us how close $x$ should be to $p$ so that $f(x)$ will be within the first neighborhood $N_1(A)$. 
The essential part is that, for *every* $N_1(A)$, no matter how small, there is some neighborhood $N_2(p)$ to satisfy our definition.

The definition of limit can also be formulated in terms of the radii of the neighborhoods $N_1(A)$ and $N_2(p)$. It is customary to denote the radius of $N_1(A)$ by $\epsilon$ and the radius of $N_2(p)$ by $\delta$. The statement $f(x) \in N_1(A)$ is equivalent to the inequality $|f(x) - A| < \epsilon$, and the statement $x \in N_2(p)$, $x \neq p$, is equivalent to the inequalities $0 < |x - p| < \delta$.

Therefore, we can express the definition of the limit as follows: 

*** $\epsilon - \delta$ definition of a limit

The symbol $\lim\limits_{x \to p} f(x) = A$ means that for every $\epsilon > 0$, there is a $\delta > 0$ such that $|f(x) - A| < \epsilon$ whenever $0 < |x - p| < \delta$.

We note that the three statements:

- $\lim\limits_{x \to p} f(x) = A$
- $\lim\limits_{x \to p} (f(x) - A) = 0$
- $\lim\limits_{x \to p} |f(x) - A| = 0$

are all equivalent.

*** One Sided Limits

If $f(x) \to A$ as $x \to p$ through values greater than $p$, we say that $A$ is the right-hand limit of $f$ at $p$, and we indicate this by writing

$\lim\limits_{x \to p+} f(x) = A$

In neighborhood terminology, this means that for every neighborhood $N_1(A)$, there is some neighborhood $N_2(p)$ such that $f(x) \in N_1(A)$ whenever $x \in N_2(p)$ and $x > p$

Left-hand limits are similarly defined by restricting $x$ to values less than $p$.

** The Definition of Continuity of a Function

*** Definition of Continuity of a Function at a Point

A function $f$ is said to be continuous at a point $p$ if 

a. $f$ is defined at $p$
b. $\lim\limits_{x \to p} f(x) = f(p)$

This can also be formulated in terms of neighborhoods. 

A function $f$ is continuous at $p$ if for every neighborhood $N_1(f(p))$ there is a neighborhood $N_2(p)$ such that 

$f(x) \in N_1[f(p)]$ whenever $x \in N_2(p)$

In the $\epsilon , \delta$ terminology, where we specify the radii of the neighborhoods, the definition of continuity can be restated as follows: 

A function $f$ is continuous at $p$ if for every $\epsilon > 0$ there is a $\delta > 0$ such that $|f(x) - f(p)| < \epsilon$ whenever $|x - p| < \delta$

** The Basic Limit Theorems. More examples of Continuous Functions 

*** Theorem 3.1

Let $f$ and $g$ be functions such that 

$\lim\limits_{x \to p} f(x) = A$, $\lim\limits_{x \to p} g(x) = B$

Then we have

1. $\lim\limits_{x \to p} [f(x) + g(x)] = A + B$

2. $\lim\limits_{x \to p} [f(x) - g(x)] = A - B$

3. $\lim\limits_{x \to p} [f(x) \cdot g(x)] = A \cdot B$

4. $\lim\limits_{x \to p} [f(x) / g(x)] = A / B$ if $B \neq 0$

*** Theorem 3.2

Let $f$ and $g$ be continuous at a point $p$. Then the sum $f + g$, the difference $f - g$, and the product $f \cdot g$ are also continuous at $p$. The same is true of the quotient $f/g$ if $g(p) \neq 0$

*** Theorem 3.3 : Squeezing Principle

Suppose that $f(x) \leq g(x) \leq h(x)$ for all $x \neq p$ in some neighborhood $N(p)$. Suppose also that $\lim\limits_{x \to p} f(x) = \lim\limits_{x \to p} h(x) = a$. Then we also have $\lim\limits_{x \to p} g(x) = a$.

The squeezing principle is useful in practice because it is often possible to find squeezing functions $f$ and $h$ which are easier to deal with than $g$.

*** Theorem 3.4 : Continuity of Indefinite Integrals

Assume $f$ is integrable on $[a, x]$ for every $x \in [a, b]$, and let $A(x) = \int_a^x f(t) dt$. Then the indefinite integral $A$ is continuous at each point of $[a, b]$. (At each endpoint we have one-sided continuity.)

$sin(a) - sin(b)  = 2 sin(\frac{a + b}{2})cos(\frac{a - b}{2})$

** Composite Functions and Continuity

   In this section we learn a way to construct functions by an operation known as composition.

   Let $u, v$ be any two given functions. The composite, or composition of $u$ and $v$ is defined to be the function $f$ for which $f(x) = u[v(x)]$ (read as "u of v of x"). Another notation we will use is $f = u \circ v$.

   The associative law always holds for function composition, but the commutative law doesn't.


*** Theorem 3.5 : Continuity Preserved Under Composition

    Assume $v$ is continuous at $p$ and that $u$ is continuous at $q$, where $q = v(p)$. Then the composite function $f = u \circ v$ is continuous at $p$.

** Bolzano's Theorem for Continuous Functions


*** Theorem 3.6 : Bolzano's Theorem

    Let $f$ be continuous at each point of a closed interval $[a, b]$ and assume that $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ have opposite signs. Then there is at least one $c$ in the open interval $(a, b)$ such that $f(c) = 0$

*** Theorem 3.7 : Sign-Preserving Property of Continuous Functions

    Let $f$ be continuous at $c$ and suppose that $f(c) \neq 0$. Then there is an interval $(c - \delta, c + \delta)$ about $c$ in which $f$ has the same sign as $f(c)$.

** The Intermediate Value Theorem for Continuous Functions

*** Theorem 3.8 : Intermediate Value Thorem for Continuous Functions

    Let $f$ be continuous at each point of a closed interval $[a, b]$. Choose two arbitrary points $x_1 < x_2$ in $[a, b]$ such that $f(x_1) \neq f(x_2)$. Then $f$ takes on every value between $f(x_1)$ and $f(x_2)$ somewhere in the interval $(x_1, x_2)$.

*** Theorem 3.9

    If $n$ is a positive integer and if $a > 0$, then there is exactly one positive $b$ such that $b^n = a$


** The Process of Inversion

This method is often used to construct new functions from given ones.

Consider a general function $f$ with domain $A$ and range $B$. For each $x \in A$, there is exactly one $y \in B$ such that $y = f(x)$. For each $y \in B$, there is at least one $x \in A$ such that $f(x) = y$. Suppose that there is exactly one such $x$. Then we can define a function $g$ on $B$ as follows: $g(y) = x$ means $y = f(x)$.

The process of inversion can be applied to any function $f$ having the property that for each $y$ in the range of $f$, there is exactly one $x$ in the domain of $f$ such that $f(x) = y$ for all $y \in B$.

Every continuous strictly monotonic function has an inverse. We can also describe inversion in terms of ordered pairs: $(y, x) \in g$ iff $(x, y) \in f$. If $f$ is strictly monotonic, then no two pairs in $f$ have the same second element, and hence no two pairs of $g$ have the same first element. Thus $g$ is a function.

** Properties of Functions Preserved by Inversion

*** Theorem 3.10

    Assume $f$ is strictly increasing and continuous on an interval $[a, b]$. Let $c = f(a)$ and $d = f(b)$ and let $g$ be the inverse of $f$. That is, for each $y \in [c, d]$, let $g(y)$ be that $x \in [a, b]$ such that $y = f(x)$. Then

    1. $g$ is strictly increasing on $[c, d]$
    2. $g$ is continuous on $[c, d]$

** Inverses of Piecewise Monotonic Functions

   Suppose we have $f(x) = x^2$ on the domain $[-c, c]$. We can solve for $x$ in terms of $y$, but there are two values of $x$ corresponding to each $y$ in $(0, c^2)$, namely $x = \sqrt y, x = - \sqrt y$. Since our modern conception of functions does not admit double-valuedness as a property of functions, we say the process of inversion gives rise to two new functions, $g_1$, $g_2$, where $g_1(y) = \sqrt y$, $g_2(y) = - \sqrt y$. These may be considered distinct functions because they have different domains, i.e. $f_1(x) = x^2$ if $0 \leq x \leq c$ and $f_2(x) = x^2$ if $-c \leq x \leq 0$.

This illustrates how the process of inversion can be applied to piecewise monotonic functions. We simply consider such a function as a union of monotonic functions and invert each monotonic piece.

** The Extreme Value Theorem for Continuous Functions

Let $f$ be a real-valued function defined on a set $S$ of real numbers. The function $f$ is said to have an absolute maximum on the set $S$ if there is at least one point $c \in S$ such that $f(x) \leq f(c)$ for all $x \in S$.

We say that $f$ has an absolute minimum on $S$ if there is a point $d \in S$ such that $f(d) \leq f(x)$ for all $x \in S$.

*** Theorem 3.11 : Boundedness Theorem for Continuous Functions

Let $f$ be continuous on a closed interval $[a, b]$. Then $f$ is bounded on $[a, b]$. That is, there is a number $C \geq 0$ such that $|f(x)| \leq C$ for all $x \in [a, b]$.
