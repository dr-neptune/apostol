** Informal Description of Continuity

Roughly:

Suppose a function $f$ has the value $f(p)$ at a certain point $p$. Then $f$ is said to be continuous at $p$ if at every nearby point $x$ the function value $f(x)$ is close to $f(p)$.

** The Definition of the Limit of a Function

Let $f$ be a function defined in some open interval containing a point $p$, although we do not insist that $f$ be defined at the point $p$ itself. Let $A$ be a real number. The equation

$\lim\limits_{x \to p} f(x) = A$ 

It is also written without the limit symbol as such $f(x) \to A$ as $x \to p$

*** Definition of Neighborhood of a Point

Any open interval containing a point $p$ as its midpoint is called a neighborhood of $p$

*Notation*: Since a neighborhood $N(p)$ is an open interval symmetric about $p$, it consists of all real $x$ satisfying $p - r < x < p + r$ for some $r > 0$. $N(p;r)$ consists of all points $x$ whose distance from $p$ is less than $r$.

*** Definition of Limit of a Function

The symbolism $\lim\limits_{x \to p} f(x) = A$ means that for every neighborhood $N_1(A)$, there is some neighborhood $N_2(p)$ such that $f(x) \in N_1(A)$ whenever $x \in N_2(p)$ and $x \neq p$.

This definition involves two neighborhoods, $N_1(A)$ and $N_2(p)$. 
The neighborhood $N_1(A)$ is specified first; it tells us how close we wish $f(x)$ to be to the limit $A$.
The second neighborhood $N_2(p)$ tells us how close $x$ should be to $p$ so that $f(x)$ will be within the first neighborhood $N_1(A)$. 
The essential part is that, for *every* $N_1(A)$, no matter how small, there is some neighborhood $N_2(p)$ to satisfy our definition.

The definition of limit can also be formulated in terms of the radii of the neighborhoods $N_1(A)$ and $N_2(p)$. It is customary to denote the radius of $N_1(A)$ by $\epsilon$ and the radius of $N_2(p)$ by $\delta$. The statement $f(x) \in N_1(A)$ is equivalent to the inequality $|f(x) - A| < \epsilon$, and the statement $x \in N_2(p)$, $x \neq p$, is equivalent to the inequalities $0 < |x - p| < \delta$.

Therefore, we can express the definition of the limit as follows: 

*** $\epsilon - \delta$ definition of a limit

The symbol $\lim\limits_{x \to p} f(x) = A$ means that for every $\epsilon > 0$, there is a $\delta > 0$ such that $|f(x) - A| < \epsilon$ whenever $0 < |x - p| < \delta$.

We note that the three statements:

- $\lim\limits_{x \to p} f(x) = A$
- $\lim\limits_{x \to p} (f(x) - A) = 0$
- $\lim\limits_{x \to p} |f(x) - A| = 0$

are all equivalent.

*** One Sided Limits

If $f(x) \to A$ as $x \to p$ through values greater than $p$, we say that $A$ is the right-hand limit of $f$ at $p$, and we indicate this by writing

$\lim\limits_{x \to p+} f(x) = A$

In neighborhood terminology, this means that for every neighborhood $N_1(A)$, there is some neighborhood $N_2(p)$ such that $f(x) \in N_1(A)$ whenever $x \in N_2(p)$ and $x > p$

Left-hand limits are similarly defined by restricting $x$ to values less than $p$.

** The Definition of Continuity of a Function

*** Definition of Continuity of a Function at a Point

A function $f$ is said to be continuous at a point $p$ if 

a. $f$ is defined at $p$
b. $\lim\limits_{x \to p} f(x) = f(p)$

This can also be formulated in terms of neighborhoods. 

A function $f$ is continuous at $p$ if for every neighborhood $N_1(f(p))$ there is a neighborhood $N_2(p)$ such that 

$f(x) \in N_1[f(p)]$ whenever $x \in N_2(p)$

In the $\epsilon , \delta$ terminology, where we specify the radii of the neighborhoods, the definition of continuity can be restated as follows: 

A function $f$ is continuous at $p$ if for every $\epsilon > 0$ there is a $\delta > 0$ such that $|f(x) - f(p)| < \epsilon$ whenever $|x - p| < \delta$

** The Basic Limit Theorems. More examples of Continuous Functions 

*** Theorem 3.1

Let $f$ and $g$ be functions such that 

$\lim\limits_{x \to p} f(x) = A$, $\lim\limits_{x \to p} g(x) = B$

Then we have

1. $\lim\limits_{x \to p} [f(x) + g(x)] = A + B$

2. $\lim\limits_{x \to p} [f(x) - g(x)] = A - B$

3. $\lim\limits_{x \to p} [f(x) \cdot g(x)] = A \cdot B$

4. $\lim\limits_{x \to p} [f(x) / g(x)] = A / B$ if $B \neq 0$

*** Theorem 3.2

Let $f$ and $g$ be continuous at a point $p$. Then the sum $f + g$, the difference $f - g$, and the product $f \cdot g$ are also continuous at $p$. The same is true of the quotient $f/g$ if $g(p) \neq 0$

*** Theorem 3.3 : Squeezing Principle

Suppose that $f(x) \leq g(x) \leq h(x)$ for all $x \neq p$ in some neighborhood $N(p)$. Suppose also that $\lim\limits_{x \to p} f(x) = \lim\limits_{x \to p} h(x) = a$. Then we also have $\lim\limits_{x \to p} g(x) = a$.
