#+TITLE: Complex Numbers

* Definition and Field Properties

If $a$ and $b$ are real numbers, the pair $(a, b)$ is called a complex number, provided that equality, addition, and multiplication of pairs is defined as follows:

Equality: $(a,b) = (c, d)$ means $a = c, b = d$
Sum:      $(a, b) + (c, d) = (a + c, b + d)$
Product:  $(a, b)(c, d) = (ac - bd, ad + bc)$

** Theorem 9.1 (Laws)
 The operations of addition and multiplicatoin of complex numbers satisfy the commutative, associative, and distributive laws. That is, if $x, y, z$ are arbitrary complex numbers, we have the following:

 Commutativity:      $x + y = y + x$
 Associtivity:       $x + (y + z) = (x + y) + z$
 Distibutive:        $x(y + z) = xy + xz$
 Additive Identity:       $(0, 0)$
 Multiplicative Identity: $(1, 0)$
 Additive Inverse:        $(-a, -b) + (a, b) = (0, 0)$, we write $-(a, b)$ for $(-a, -b)$
 Reciprocal Relative to Identity $(1, 0)$:

 $\frac{1}{(a, b)} = (c, d)$

 where

 $c = \frac{a}{a^2 + b^2}$
 $d = \frac{-b}{a^2 + b^2}$

* The Complex Numbers as an Extension of the Real Numbers

Let $\mathbb{C}_0$ denote the subset of $\mathbb{C}$ consisting of all complex numbers of the form $(a, 0)$. That is, all complex numbers with zero imaginary sum. These are the real numbers.

The two fields $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{C}_0$ are said to be isomorphic. The function $f(x) = (x, 0)$ is called an isomorphism.

The complex number system $\mathbb{C}$ is called an extension of the real-number system $\mathbb{R}$ because it contains a subset $\mathbb{C}_0$ which is isomorphic to $\mathbb{R}$.

* The Imaginary Unit $i$

The complex number $(0, 1)$ is denoted by $i$ and is called the imaginary unit. It has the property that its square is -1, $i^2 = -1$.

** Theorem 9.2

Every complex number $(a, b)$ can be expressed in the form $(a, b) = a + bi$

** Quadratic Formula

Consider the quadratic equation. If the discriminant $b^2 - 4ac < 0$, then there are 2 complex roots, given by the formulas:

$r_1 = - \frac{b}{2a} + i \frac{\sqrt{4ac - b^2}}{2a}$

$r_2 = - \frac{b}{2a} - i \frac{\sqrt{4ac - b^2}}{2a}$

** Fundamental Theorem of Algebra

Every polynomial equation of the form $a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 + ... + a_nx^n = 0$ where $a_0, a_1, ..., a_n$ are arbitrary real numbers,
with $a_n \neq 0$ has a solution among the complex numbers if $n \geq 1$.

Moreover, even if the coefficients are complex, a solution exists in the complex-number system. This shows there is no need to construct
numbers more general than complex numbers to solve polynomial equations with complex coefficients.

* Geometric Interpretation. Modulus and Argument

** Polar Notation

If $(x, y) \neq (0, 0)$, we can express x and y in polar coordinates:

$x = r \cos \theta$
$y = r \sin \theta$
$x + iy = r(\cos \theta + i \sin \theta)$

The positive number $r$, which represents the distance of $(x, y)$ from the origin, is called the modulus or absolute value of $x + iy$ and is denoted by $|x + iy|$.
Thus we have $|x + iy| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$

** Absolute Values of Complex Numbers

$|z| > 0$ if $z \neq 0$

$|z_1 - z_2| = |z_2 - z_1|$

$|z_1 + z_2| \leq |z_1| + |z_2|$

$|z_1 z_2| = |z_1||z_2|$

$|\frac{z_1}{z_2}| = \frac{|z_1|}{|z_2|}$

** Complex Conjugate

If $z = x + iy$, the complex conjugate of $z$ is the complex number $\bar{z} = x - iy$

Geometrically, $\bar{z}$ represents the reflection of $z$ through the real axis.

$\overline{z_1 + z_2} = \bar{z_1} + \bar{z_2}$

$\overline{z_1 z_2} = \bar{z_1} \bar{z_2}$

$\overline{z_1 / z_2} = \bar{z_1} \bar{z_2}$

$z \bar{z} = |z|^2$

** Quadratic Roots

If a quadratic equation with real coefficients has no real roots, its complex roots are conjugates.

* Complex Exponentials

** Definition : Complex Exponential

If $z = x + iy$, we define $e^z$ to be the complex number given by the equation $e^z = e^x(\cos y + i \sin y)$

Note that $e^z = e^x$ when $y = 0$

** Theorem 9.3 : Complex Exponential Identity

If $a, b \in \mathbb{C}$, we have $e^a e^b = e^{a + b}$

** Theorem 9.4 : Polar Form

Every complex number $z \neq 0$ can be expressed in the form $z = re^{i \theta}$
where $r = |z|$ and $\theta = \arg (z) + 2n\pi$ where $n \in \mathbb{Z}$

This representation is called the polar form of $z$.

** Multiplication of Complex Numbers in Polar Form

$z_1 z_2 = r_1 e^{i\theta} r_2 e^{i\phi} = r_1 r_2 e^{i (\theta + \phi)}$

$z^n = r^n e^{in\theta} = r^n (\cos n \theta + i \sin n \theta)$

** Division of Complex Numbers in Polar Form

$\frac{z^1}{z_2} = \frac{r^1 e^{i \theta}}{r_2 e^{i \phi}} = \frac{r_1}{r_2} e^{i(\theta - \phi)}$

* Complex-Valued Functions

A function $f$ whose values are complex numbers is called a complex-valued function. If the domain of $f$ is the set of real numbers, $f$ is called a complex-valued function of a real variable. If the domain of $f$ is the set of complex numbers, $f$ is called a complex-valued function of a complex variable, or more simply, a function of a complex variable.
