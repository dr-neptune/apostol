* Polynomial Approximations to Functions

  If the difference between a function and its polynomial approximation is sufficiently small, then we can, for practical purposes, compute with the polynomial in place of the original function.

  In this chapter, we shall be interested in obtaining a polynomial which agrees with f and some of its derivatives at a given point.

  We can approximate $e^x$ with tighter and tighter bounds with a polynomial which agrees with its first n terms about some point:

  $P(x) = \sum_{i = 0}^n \frac{x^i}{i!}$

* The Taylor Polynomials Generated by a Function

** Theorem 7.1 : Taylor Polynomials

   Let $f$ be a function with derivatives of order $n$ at the point $x = 0$. Then there exists one and only one polynomial $P$ of degree $\leq n$ which satisfies the $n + 1$ conditions

   $P(0) = f(0), P'(0) = f'(0), ..., P^{(n)}(0) = f^{(n)}(0)$

   This polynomial is given by the formula

   $P(x) = \sum_{k = 0}^{n} \frac{f^{(k)}(0)}{k!} x^k$

   In the same way, we may show that there is one and only one polynomial of degree $\leq n$ which agrees with $f$ and its first $n$ derivatives at a point $x = a$.

   $P(x) = \sum_{k = 0}^n \frac{f^{(k)}(a)}{k!} (x - a)^k$

   This is the one and only polynomial of degree $\leq n$ which satisfies the conditions

   $P(a) = f(a), P'(a) = f'(a), ..., P^{(n)}(a) = f^{(n)}(a)$

   and it is referred to as a **Taylor Polynomial**, or more precisely, the Taylor Polynomial of degree $n$ generated by $f$ at the point $a$.

   It is convenient to have a notation that indicates the dependence of the Taylor polynomial $P$ on $f$ and $n$. We shall indicate this by writing
   $P = T_n(f)$. The symbol $T_n$ is called the Taylor operator of degree $n$. When this operator is applied to a function, it produces a new function $T_n f$, the Taylor polynomial of degree $n$.
   The value of this function at $x$ is denoted by $T_n[f(x)]$ or $T_n f(x; a)$ if we wish to indicate the dependence on $a$.
