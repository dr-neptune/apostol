* 10.1 : Zeno's Paradox

This section introduces the ideas of convergence and divergence by illustrating Zeno's paradox with the convergent sum $\Sigma_k \frac{1}{2^k}$ and the divergent sum $\Sigma_k \frac{1}{k}$

* 10.2 : Sequences

In mathematics, sequence and series mean different things

** Relaxed Definition : Sequence

If for every positive integer $n$ there is associated a real or complex number $a_n$ then the ordered set $a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_n$, ... is said to define an infinite sequence.

The important thing here is that each member of the set has been labeled with an integer so that we may speak of the first, second, nth term. Each term $a_n$ has a successor $a_{n + 1}$ and hence there is no "last" term.

** Technical Definition : Sequence

A function $f$ whose domain is the set of all positive integers $1, 2, 3$, ... is called an infinite sequence. The function value $f(n)$ is called the nth term of the sequence.
